\section{Implementation of MHDP}
For the implementation we used Python.
To implement the MHDP algorithm we followed the pseudocodes present in 
the paper where possible. In particular, for the generation of the population, the crossover
and the adjustment of the solutions we used the pseudocodes.
The mutation operation was easy to implement, we only needed to select two different random individuals and apply (\ref{eqn:pso}).
To implement the evaluation procedure we had to implement also the 
\textit{fast non-dominated sort} algorithm to find the pareto fronts.
