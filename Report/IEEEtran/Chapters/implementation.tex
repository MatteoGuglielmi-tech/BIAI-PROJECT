\section{Implementation of MHDP}
The code for the implementation has been written in Python. As a requirement, some very popular Python modules have been used alongside the "genetic oriented" module \textit{inspyred}.
Concerning the implementation of the MHDP algorithm, we followed the pseudocodes present in the paper for : the generation of the initial population, the crossover operator
and the adjustment of infeasible solutions.
The mutation operation was easy to implement, we only needed to select two different random individuals from the pool of possible solutions and apply (\ref{eqn:pso}).
Reguarding the evaluation procedure, we had to implement also the 
\textit{fast non-dominated sort} algorithm to find the Pareto fronts.
