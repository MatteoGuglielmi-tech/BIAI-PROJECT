\section{Conclusion}
During the development of the project we had the opportunity to apply EC on a real world scenario 
and to implement EAs by hand to deeper understand their functioning. Moreover, we devised something that may be useful for others and may make the work
of firefighters more efficient.\\
While reading the chosen paper, we found some unclear explanations; however, after a quick reading of the papers referenced by the authors, we were able to understand better how to proceed.
Eventually, this work turned out to be very satisfactory. Indeed, we were able to reach significant results starting with minimal experience in genetic programming (as we all know, theorethical background sometimes doesn't help that much in practice) and we had the opportunity to experiment and verify the power of such bio-inspired algorithms.
