\section{contributions}
Davide and Matteo worked together to implement the algorithm.
Usually, for each section of the paper\cite{fire_distinguish}, we decided by chat or by a video call,
what function to implement. Then, depending on the available time, each of us
worked on the code when the other member couldn't. In this way we were able 
to review what the other did and correct possible errors or bugs.\\
Following the above procedure, Davide implemented most part of the crossover, mutation and fast non-dominated sort algorithms,
while Matteo implemented most part of the population generation, fitness computation and evaluation algorithms.
