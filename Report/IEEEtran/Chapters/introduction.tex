\section{Introduction}
The problem of forest fires is becoming a big issue all around the world. With the continuous rise in temperature and with the less frequent rains in summer, the number of forest fires is increasing every year. However, the number of rescue vehicles is limited and, in case of multiple fire points, deciding how many vehicles to use for each fire point is a difficult task that has to be solved very quickly. In particular, different fire points may have different weather characteristics, like the temperature and the wind speed, and different terrain characteristics, like the slope and the type of terrain, and these parameters have to be taken into account during the decision of the number of vehicles for each fire point. Finally, the distance of the fire point to the fire department and the time that each vehicle takes to extinguish a fire are very important parameters.\\
In the paper \textit{Dual-Objective Scheduling of Rescue Vehicles to Distinguish Forest Fires via Differential Evolution and Particle Swarm Optimization Combined Algorithm}\cite{fire_distinguish}, by Tian, G., Ren, Y. \& Zhou, M., the authors present a  Multi-objective Hybrid Differential-evolution and Particle-swarm-optimization (MHDP) algorithm to minimize the time spent to extinguish a fire while minimizing the total number of vehicles used.
