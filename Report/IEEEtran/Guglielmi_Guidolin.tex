\begin{abstract}
With the increasing issue of global warming, the problem of forest fires during summer seasons is becoming more severe every year.
For this reason we decided to focus our attention on a project that could possibly deal with this problem. Our attention landed on the paper 
\textit{"Dual-Objective Scheduling of Rescue Vehicles to Distinguish Forest Fires via Differential Evolution and Particle Swarm Optimization Combined Algorithm"}
written by \textit{Guangdong Tian, Yaping Ren, and MengChu Zhou, Fellow, IEEE}. 
In this paper the authors present a method to optimize the fire distinguish time and the number of vehicles used to distinguish a set of fires and their approach is applied to a real-world scenario in Mt. Daxingâ€™anling, China.
The focus of our project is the implementation and testing of their approach.
