\begin{abstract}
With the increasing issue of global warming, the problem of forest fires during the summer season is becoming more severe every year.
For this reason we decided to focus our attention on a project that could possibly deal with this problem. Our attention landed on the paper 
\textit{"Dual-Objective Scheduling of Rescue Vehicles to Distinguish Forest Fires via Differential Evolution and Particle Swarm Optimization Combined Algorithm"}
written by \textit{Guangdong Tian, Yaping Ren, and MengChu Zhou, Fellow, IEEE}. 
In this paper the authors presented a method to optimize the deployment of vehicles used to distinguish a set of fire points with the objectives of minimize the disinguishing time and the number of motorcade used. \\
Interestingly, to test this approach, it has been applied to a real-world scenario in Mt. Daxingâ€™anling, China.\\
